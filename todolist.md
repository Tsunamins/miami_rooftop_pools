Todo:
Have Todo:
    -do something with lists of pools on a user home page
    -find a way to hypertext the result of the pool's webpage   
    -go back through and clean up css and html, centering or keeping certain items to left, i.e Create An account part of div of whole sign up form, make certain fields smaller, etc//thehotel has some ideal centering arrangment by comparison
    -do blog
    -do video demonstration
    -clean up view when in a smaller screen

May want to add before submission:
    -some additional model like user comments on other people's pools, or heart function or something else
    

Maybe Todo:
    -maybe find a randomized funtion to show random pools on user's page, in the features section
    -maybe add ability to view a page with a certain user's pool's, in other words build route by username and list all of that person's pools
    -maybe embed a map - not sure
    -maybe add pool pictures
    -maybe add edit and delete abilities along side logged in user's pool lists
