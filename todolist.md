temporary notes:
    -do something with lists of pools on a user home page
    -find a way to hypertext the result of the pool's webpage
    -maybe find a randomized funtion to show random pools on user's page, in the features section
    -go back through and clean up css and html, centering or keeping certain items to left, i.e Create An account part of div of whole sign up form, make certain fields smaller, etc//thehotel has some ideal centering arrangment by comparison
    -maybe add ability to view a page with a certain user's pool's, in other words build route by username and list all of that person's pools
